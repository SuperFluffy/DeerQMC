# Code - this is the currently relevant part
- [ ] Refactor code
- [ ] Move some logic into classes
- [ ] Introduce tests
- [ ] Add statistics & calculation of the signs

# Numerics
- [ ] Profile
- [ ] Faster update of the Green's function
- [ ] Cythonize the bottlenecks

# Availability
- [ ] Package the code to make it easy to install

# Physics
- [ ] Calculate observables from the stored configurations
- [ ] Other geometries (e.g. hexagonal, honeycomb, 3D)
