Introduction
============

DeerQMC is an implementation of the Determinantal Quantum Monte Carlo
simulation to study the one- and two-dimensional Hubbard models. Its main
feature is that it implements an anisotropic transformation of the
electron-electron interaction on every lattice site, which can be chosen
freely.

Documentation & citation
------------------------

A full documentation on how to use this software is in preparation. In the
meantime, more information on that can be found in my MSc thesis, which can be
provide upon request.

If you obtained your numerical results using this software, I would kindly ask
you to send me an email with a reference to your work, and to cite this
software as:

```

Work in progress
----------------

DeerQMC is currently under heavy development and therefore by no means stable.

The `TODO` contains some information on the outstanding fixes and possible
extensions.

Monte Carlo calculations of field theories with Fermionic degrees of freedom by
integrating these out.

electron-electron interaction by a coupling to Bosonic (Ising) fields.
